# Component Architecture Rules

## Single Component Per File

- Each React component must be declared in its own separate file
- Never declare more than one component and its interface in a single file
- Each component file should have a clear, single responsibility
- Component file names must use kebab-case (e.g., "my-component.tsx")

## Component Structure

- Components should be as reusable as possible
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Declare interfaces in the same file as the component, not in separate files
- Follow the pattern: one interface, one component per file

## File Organization

- Components should be organized in the `components/` directory by feature/module
- Use clear, descriptive file names that indicate the component's purpose
- Group related components in subdirectories (e.g., `components/catalog/`, `components/admin/`)

## Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Use shadcn/ui components as the base for custom components
- Make components as reusable as possible by accepting className props
- Follow consistent spacing and design patterns across components
