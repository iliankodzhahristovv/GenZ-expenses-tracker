# Constants and Configuration

## Constants Management

- Use the [lib/constants.ts](mdc:lib/constants.ts) file for URL route names and SWR query keys
- Check if a route matches by creating arrays and using `includes()` instead of chaining comparisons with `||` operator
- Define all constants in the constants file, not inline in components

## SWR Query Keys

- All SWR query keys must be defined in `SWR_KEYS` constant object
- Use descriptive, kebab-case names for query keys
- Include parameters in query key arrays: `[SWR_KEYS.KEY_NAME, ...params]`

## Package Management

- Use only pnpm as the package manager for all operations
- Never use npm or yarn commands
- Use `pnpm add`, `pnpm install`, `pnpm run` for all package operations

## Configuration Files

- Keep configuration files in the `lib/` directory
- Use TypeScript for configuration files when possible
- Export configuration objects with proper typing
- Use environment variables for environment-specific configuration

## Route Management

- Define all routes in the `ROUTES` constant object
- Use route functions for dynamic routes (e.g., `ROUTES.PROJECT_DETAIL(projectId)`)
- Follow consistent naming patterns for routes
